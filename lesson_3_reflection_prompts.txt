When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Whenever I want to save my changes to Github

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There maybe times where others have made changes to the remote repository - doing it manually gives more control

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks - make a copy of a repository on github. Will be used when you want to modify the repository without touching the original repository
Clones - make a copy of a repository locally. Make exact copy of a repository on the local machine
Branches - Branch a commit - when you want to add a new or expiremental feature to your code
