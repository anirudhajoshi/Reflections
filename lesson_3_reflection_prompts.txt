When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Whenever I want to save my changes to Github

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There maybe times where others have made changes to the remote repository - doing it manually gives more control

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks - make a copy of a repository on github. Will be used when you want to modify the repository without touching the original repository
Clones - make a copy of a repository locally. Make exact copy of a repository on the local machine
Branches - Branch a commit - when you want to add a new or expiremental feature to your code

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So we can compare differences offline

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
VIa email. It would be hard to track and preserve histories and comments. For small set of files with trivial changes emails might work but would break for real world projects.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Make changes to a seperate branch instead of master when you are trying out new features/experimenting. 
Pros - experimental/untested code is seperate than production code
Code - more overhead to keep maintain branches on both Github & in git
